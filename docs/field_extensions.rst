:synopsis: Current Field Extensions


Current Database Model Field Extensions
---------------------------------------

* *AutoSlugField* - AutoSlugfield will automatically create a unique slug
  incrementing an appended number on the slug until it is unique. Inspired by
  SmileyChris' Unique Slugify snippet.

* *RandomCharField* - AutoRandomCharField will automatically create a
  unique random character field with the specified length. By default
  upper/lower case and digits are included as possible characters. Given
  a length of 8 thats yields 3.4 million possible combinations. A 12
  character field would yield about 2 billion. Below are some examples::

    >>> RandomCharField(length=8, unique=True)
    BVm9GEaE

    >>> RandomCharField(length=4, include_alpha=False)
    7097

    >>> RandomCharField(length=12, include_punctuation=True)
    k[ZS.TR,0LHO

    >>> RandomCharField(length=12, lowercase=True, include_digits=False)

* *CreationDateTimeField* - DateTimeField that will automatically set its date
  when the object is first saved to the database. Works in the same way as the
  auto_now_add keyword.

* *ModificationDateTimeField* - DateTimeField that will automatically set its
  date when an object is saved to the database. Works in the same way as the
  auto_now keyword. It is possible to preserve the current timestamp by setting update_modified to False::

    >>> example = MyTimeStampedModel.objects.get(pk=1)

    >>> print example.modified
    datetime.datetime(2016, 3, 18, 10, 3, 39, 740349, tzinfo=<UTC>)

    >>> example.save(update_modified=False)

    >>> print example.modified
    datetime.datetime(2016, 3, 18, 10, 3, 39, 740349, tzinfo=<UTC>)

    >>> example.save()

    >>> print example.modified
    datetime.datetime(2016, 4, 8, 14, 25, 43, 123456, tzinfo=<UTC>)

  It is also possible to set the attribute directly on the model,
  for example when you don't use the TimeStampedModel provided in this package, or when you are in a migration::

    >>> example = MyCustomModel.objects.get(pk=1)

    >>> print example.modified
    datetime.datetime(2016, 3, 18, 10, 3, 39, 740349, tzinfo=<UTC>)

    >>> example.update_modified=False

    >>> example.save()

    >>> print example.modified
    datetime.datetime(2016, 3, 18, 10, 3, 39, 740349, tzinfo=<UTC>)

* *UUIDField* - UUIDField for Django, supports all uuid versions that are
  natively supported by the uuid python module.

  .. deprecated:: 1.4.7
     Django 1.8 features a native UUIDField. Django-Extensions will support *UUIDField* at the very least until Django 1.7 becomes unsupported.

* *PostgreSQLUUIDField* - UUIDField for Django, uses PostgreSQL uuid type.

  .. deprecated:: 1.4.7
     Django 1.8 features a native UUIDField. Django-Extensions will support *UUIDField* at the very least until Django 1.7 becomes unsupported.

* *EncryptedCharField* - CharField which transparently encrypts its value as it goes in and out of the database.  Encryption is handled by `Keyczar <http://www.keyczar.org/>`_.  To use this field you must have Keyczar installed, have generated a primary encryption key, and have ``settings.ENCRYPTED_FIELD_KEYS_DIR`` set to the full path of your keys directory.

* *EncryptedTextField* - CharField which transparently encrypts its value as it goes in and out of the database.  Encryption is handled by `Keyczar <http://www.keyczar.org/>`_.  To use this field you must have Keyczar installed, have generated a primary encryption key, and have ``settings.ENCRYPTED_FIELD_KEYS_DIR`` set to the full path of your keys directory.

* *ShortUUIDField* - CharField which transparently generates a UUID and pass it to base57. It result in shorter 22 characters values useful e.g. for concise, unambiguous URLS. It's possible to get shorter values with length parameter: they are not Universal Unique any more but probability of collision is still low

* *JSONField* - a generic TextField that neatly serializes/unserializes JSON objects seamlessly

  .. deprecated:: 1.7.3
     Django 1.9 features a native JSONField. Django-Extensions will support *JSONField* at the very least until Django 1.8 becomes unsupported.
