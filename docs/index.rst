   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to the django-extensions documentation!
===============================================

Django Extensions is a collection of custom extensions for the Django Framework.

These include management commands, additional database fields, admin extensions and
much more.

`这篇文档当然还有中文版 <http://django-extensions-zh.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_

Getting Started
===============

The easiest way to figure out what Django Extensions are all about is to watch the `excellent screencast by Eric Holscher`__. In a couple minutes Eric walks you through a half a dozen command extensions.

Getting it
==========

You can get Django Extensions by using pip or easy_install::

 $ pip install django-extensions
 or
 $ easy_install django-extensions

If you want to install it from source, grab the git repository and run setup.py::

 $ git clone git://github.com/django-extensions/django-extensions.git
 $ cd django-extensions
 $ python setup.py install

For more detailed instructions check out our :doc:`installation_instructions`. Enjoy.

Compatibility with versions of Python and Django
=================================================

We try to follow the Django guidelines for supported Python and Django versions.

This might mean the django-extensions may work with older or unsupported versions but we do not guarantee it and most likely will not fix bugs related to incompatibilities with older versions.

At the time of writing we require at least Python 2.5.
