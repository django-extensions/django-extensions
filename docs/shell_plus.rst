:synopsis: Django shell with autoloading of the apps database models


Interactive Python Shells
-------------------------

There is support for three different types of interactive python shells.

IPython::

  $ ./manage.py shell_plus --ipython


BPython::

  $ ./manage.py shell_plus --bpython


Python::

  $ ./manage.py shell_plus --plain


The default resolution order is: bpython, ipython, python.

You can also set the configuration option SHELL_PLUS to explicitly specify which version you want.

::

  # Always use IPython for shell_plus
  SHELL_PLUS = "ipython"


It is also possible to use `IPython Notebook`_, an interactive Python shell which
uses a web browser as its user interface, as an alternative shell::

    $ ./manage.py shell_plus --notebook

In addition to being savable, IPython Notebooks can be updated (while running) to reflect changes in a Django application's code with the menu command `Kernel > Restart`.


Configuration
-------------

Sometimes, models from your own apps and other people's apps have colliding names,
or you may want to completely skip loading an app's models. Here are some examples of how to do that.

Note: These settings are only used inside shell_plus and will not affect your environment.

::

  # Rename the automatic loaded module Messages in the app blog to blog_messages.
  SHELL_PLUS_MODEL_ALIASES = {'blog': {'Messages': 'blog_messages'},}
  }

::

  # Prefix all automatically loaded models in the app blog with myblog.
  SHELL_PLUS_APP_PREFIXES = {'blog': 'myblog',}
  }

::

  # Dont load the 'sites' app, and skip the model 'pictures' in the app 'blog'
  SHELL_PLUS_DONT_LOAD = ['sites', 'blog.pictures']
  }


You can also combine model_aliases and dont_load.

It is possible to ignore autoloaded modules when using manage.py, like::

  $ ./manage.py shell_plus --dont-load app1 --dont-load app2.module1

Commandline parameters and settings in the configuration file are merged, so you can
safely append modules to ignore from the commandline for one-time usage.

There are two settings that you can use to pass your custom options to the IPython
Notebook in your Django settings.

The first one is ``NOTEBOOK_ARGUMENTS`` that can be used to hold those options that available via::

    $ ipython notebook -h

For example::

    NOTEBOOK_ARGUMENTS = [
        '--ip=x.x.x.x',
        '--port=xx',
    ]

Another one is ``IPYTHON_ARGUMENTS`` that for those options that available via::

    $ ipython -h

The Django settings module and database models are auto-loaded into the
interactive shell's global namespace also for IPython Notebook.

Auto-loading is done by a custom IPython extension which is activated by
default by passing the
``--ext django_extensions.management.notebook_extension``
argument to the Notebook.  If you need to pass custom options to the IPython
Notebook, you can override the default options in your Django settings using
the ``IPYTHON_ARGUMENTS`` setting.  For example::

    IPYTHON_ARGUMENTS = [
        '--ext', 'django_extensions.management.notebook_extension',
        '--ext', 'myproject.notebook_extension',
        '--debug',
    ]

To activate auto-loading, remember to either include the django-extensions' default
notebook extension or copy its auto-loading code into your own extension.

Note that the IPython Notebook feature doesn't currently honor the
``--dont-load`` option.

Additional Imports
------------------

In addition to importing the models you can specify other items to import by default.
These are specified in SHELL_PLUS_PRE_IMPORTS and SHELL_PLUS_POST_IMPORTS. The former is imported
before any other imports (such as the default models import) and the latter is imported after any
other imports. Both have similar syntax. So in your settings.py file:

::

    SHELL_PLUS_PRE_IMPORTS = (
        ('module.submodule1', ('class1', 'function2')),
        ('module.submodule2', 'function3'),
        ('module.submodule3', '*'),
        'module.submodule4'
    )

The above example would directly translate to the following python code which would be executed before
the automatic imports:

::

    from module.submodule1 import class1, function2
    from module.submodule2 import function3
    from module.submodule3 import *
    import module.submodule4

These symbols will be available as soon as the shell starts.


Database application signature
------------------------------

If using PostgreSQL the ``application_name`` is set by default to
``django_shell`` to help  identify queries made under shell_plus.


SQL queries
-------------------------

It is possible to print SQL queries as they're executed in shell_plus like::

  $ ./manage.py shell_plus --print-sql


You can also set the configuration option SHELL_PLUS_PRINT_SQL to omit the above command line option.

::

  # print SQL queries in shell_plus
  SHELL_PLUS_PRINT_SQL = True
