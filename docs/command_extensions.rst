Current Command Extensions
==========================

:synopsis: Current Command Extensions

* :doc:`shell_plus` - An enhanced version of the Django shell.  It will autoload
  all your models making it easy to work with the ORM right away.

* `create_app`_ - Creates an application directory structure for the specified
  app name.  This command allows you to specify the --template option where you
  can indicate a template directory structure to use as your default.

* *create_command* - Creates a command extension directory structure within the
  specified application.  This makes it easy to get started with adding a
  command extension to your application.

* *create_template_tags* - Creates a template tag directory structure within the
  specified application.

* *create_jobs* - Creates a Django jobs command directory structure for the
  given app name in the current directory.  This is part of the impressive jobs
  system.

* *create_superuser* - Makes it easy to create a superuser for the
  django.contrib.auth.

* *describe_form* - Used to display a form definition for a model. Copy and
  paste the contents into your forms.py and you're ready to go.

* :doc:`dumpscript <dumpscript>` - Generates a Python script that will
  repopulate the database using objects. The advantage of this approach is that
  it is easy to understand, and more flexible than directly populating the
  database, or using XML.

* `export_emails`_ - export the email addresses for your
  users in one of many formats.  Currently supports Address, Google, Outlook,
  LinkedIn, and VCard formats.

* *generate_secret_key* - Creates a new secret key that you can put in your
  settings.py module.

* `graph_models`_ - Creates a GraphViz_ dot file.  You need
  to send this output to a file yourself.  Great for graphing your models. Pass
  multiple application names to combine all the models into a single dot file.

* *mail_debug* - Starts a mail server which echos out the contents of the email
  instead of sending it.

* *passwd* - Makes it easy to reset a user's password.

* `print_settings`_ - Similar to ``diffsettings`` but shows *all* active Django settings.

* *print_user_for_session* - Print the user information for the provided
  session key. this is very helpful when trying to track down the person who
  experienced a site crash.

* *reset_db* - Resets a database (currently sqlite3, mysql, postgres).

* *runjob* - Run a single maintenance job.  Part of the jobs system.

* *runjobs* - Runs scheduled maintenance jobs. Specify hourly, daily, weekly,
  monthly.  Part of the jobs system.

* :doc:`runprofileserver <runprofileserver>` - Starts *runserver* with hotshot/profiling tools enabled.
  I haven't had a chance to check this one out, but it looks really cool.

* `runscript`_ - Runs a script in the django context.

* `runserver_plus`_ - The standard runserver stuff but with
  the Werkzeug debugger baked in. Requires Werkzeug_. This one kicks ass.

* *set_fake_passwords* -  Sets all user passwords to a common value (*password* by default). *DEBUG only*.

* *show_urls* - Displays the url routes that are defined in your project. Very
  crude at this point.

* :doc:`sqldiff` - Prints the (approximated) difference between an app's models and
  what is in the database.  This is very nice, but also very experimental at
  the moment.  It can not catch everything but it's a great sanity check.

* :doc:`sqlcreate` - Generates the SQL to create your database for you, as specified
  in settings.py.

* `sync_s3`_ - Copies files found in settings.MEDIA_ROOT to S3.
  Optionally can also gzip CSS and Javascript files and set the
  Content-Encoding header, and also set a far future expires header for browser
  caching.
