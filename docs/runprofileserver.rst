RunProfileServer
================

*We recommend that before you start profiling any language or
framework you learn enough about it so that you feel comfortable with digging
into its internals.*

*Without sufficient knowledge it will not only be (very)
hard but you're likely to make wrong assumptions (and fixes). As a rule of thumb,
clean, well written code will help you a lot more than overzealous
micro-optimizations will.*

*This document is work in progress. If you feel you can help with
better/clearer or additional information about profiling Django please leave a
comment.*


Introduction
------------

*runprofileserver* starts Django's runserver command with hotshot/profiling
tools enabled. It will save .prof files containing the profiling information
into the --prof-path directory. Note that for each request made one profile
data file is saved.

By default the profile-data-files are saved in /tmp use the --prof-path option
to specify your own target directory. Saving the data in a meaningful directory
structure helps to keep your profile data organized and keeps /tmp uncluttered. 
(Yes this probably malfunctions systems such as Windows where /tmp does not exist)

To define profile filenames use --prof-file option. Default format
is "{path}.{duration:06d}ms.{time}" (Python
`Format Specification <http://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec>`_
is used).

Examples:

  * "{time}-{path}-{duration}ms" - to order profile-data-files by request time
  * "{duration:06d}ms.{path}.{time}" - to order by request duration

gather_profile_stats.py
-----------------------

Django comes packed with a tool to aggregate these different prof files into
one aggregated profile file. This tool is called *gather_profile_stats.py* and
is located inside the *bin* directory of your Django distribution.


KCacheGrind
-----------

Recent versions of *runprofileserver* have an option to save the profile data
into a KCacheGrind compatible format. So you can use the excellent KCacheGrind
tool for analyzing the profile data.

Example::

  $ mkdir /tmp/my-profile-data
  $ ./manage.py runprofileserver --kcachegrind --prof-path=/tmp/my-profile-data
