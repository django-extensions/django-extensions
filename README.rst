 Django Extensions
===================

Django Extensions is a collection of custom extensions for the Django Framework.

Getting Started
===============

The easiest way to figure out what Django Extensions are all about is to watch the `excellent screencast by Eric Holscher`__. In a couple minutes Eric walks you through a half a dozen command extensions.

Getting It
==========

You can get Django Extentions by using pip or easy_install::

 $ pip install django-extensions
 or
 $ easy_install django-extensions

If you want to install it from source, grab the git repository from github and run setup.py::

 $ git clone git://github.com/django-extensions/django-extensions.git
 $ cd django-extensions
 $ python setup.py install
